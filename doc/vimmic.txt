General remarks:~
----------------

This configuration is made in order to suit every Vim user's need. If some
configuration are in conflict with your general Vim usage, please let an issue
on the Github page.

This configuration:~
-------------------

On this configuration, all shortcuts are written using the same syntax. They
are inside braces like { }. If two key are meant to be pressed simultaneously,
they are separated by a "+", if they need to by pressed in sequence by a " ".
When coming from a plugin, the plugin name is recalled between ( ).

Examples:
-`{<Leader> v}:` is pressing "<Leader>" then "v".
-`{<Ctrl+f>}(clang-format):` is pressing "<Ctrl>" and "f" simultaneously. This
shortcut come from "clang-format".

Note: see |vimmic-shortcuts|.


==============================================================================
1. Beginner's guide				*vimmic-beginner*

The main tool to start using this configuration is the quickmenu bar. It can
be summoned using <F12>. The first section of this pane contains functions to
interact with the configuration. For each of these function the corresponding
shortcut is recalled in the 'statusline'. The next section of this pane leads
to these man pages and the last one gives access to function made to interact
with the text.

Basic usage:~
------------

The leader key is defined on comma, look at |vimmic-preconfig| to change it.
The firsts steps to follow when starting using Vimmic is certainly to read the
|vimmic-config| section in order to create a personalized experience.

Update:~
-------

Updating from the Git repository can be done with:

`$ git pull --recursive`

Then, you can update all your plugins inside Vim with

`:Update`


==============================================================================
2. Vimmic configuration 		*vimmic-config*

This configuration is structured as follows:
[...]

You can customize Vimmic using two files:
 - "$HOME/|.vimrc.preconf|" to add/remove plugins and features
 - "$HOME/|.vimrc.postconf|" to configure colorscheme, plugins and personal
   stuff

Note: example for both of these files are given in the "extra/" folder.

2.1 Pre-configuration			*vimrc-preconf* *.vimrc.preconf*~
---------------------

This optional file can be used to add or remove plugins. To add a new plugin
from a Github repository you need to use the dein add function:

`call dein#add(maintainers/repo)`

If you want to disable a plugin fron the original configuration,
you can use the dein disable function:

`call dein#disable('repo')`

In both of the case, it is recommended to restart Vim,
apply the `:Update` command and restart again to apply your modifications.

This file also lets you disable some features of the configuration:
- `let g:disable_defaultColors =1`            		"disables all theming colors and words highlight defined
- `let g:disable_highlightWordUnderCursor =1` 		"disables the current word highlight
- `let g:disable_margin =1`                   		"disable the 120 characters margin

Note: Use this file if you want to change you default leader key.

2.2 Post-configuration			*vimrc-postconf* *.vimrc.postconf*~
----------------------

With this file, you can overwrite everything defined in Vimmic. This is the
good place to adapt the colorscheme to your needs and to adapt the
configuration of Vimmic's defined plugins. All your personal stuff
also belong here, you can copy your old ".vimrc" file on this one.

Note: To configure the plugins you have added, it is better to do it the
Vimmic's way like explained in the next chapter |vimmic-plugins|.
